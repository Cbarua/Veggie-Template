Pseudo elements doesn't apply to img tags. I had to wrap the social media icons in tags.

Use IntersectionObserver to trigger animation on scroll. It was previously done using offsetTop and offsetHeight properties and methods like Element.getBoundingClientRect().

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {} for accessiblity. Show animation to people who haven't opt off animation.

setTimeout allows us to run a function once after the interval of time. 
setInterval allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval.

I commited "Completed website animation" 2 days ago.
I made a mistake in the commit message and accidently pushed it before fixing it.
I made 2 other commits without any making any changes to the files trying to fix it.
Finally, I did it.
The commands
git reset --soft 3114fb6 -> Restored my project to the commit where I actually made changes.
git commit --amend -m "Completed website animations" -> Changed the commit message.
git push --force-with-lease origin test -> Force push over the old commit.

I wondered why my .contact-form textarea margin and button margin overlapped.
When two elements have vertical margins which touch each other, they effectively merge into one another.
Margin means empty space. 
When there is nothing in between (no element nor padding), margins of 2 elements collapses. 
Use padding if background is needed.
However, the direct descendants of grid and flex parents do not have collapsing margins.

I learned that mobile-first web development is the best way to go.
Use 'min-width' media queries to change elements respond to large screen sizes.
However, sometimes we go back to default styles for large screen.
I noticed that with my .nav-menu class.
I changed the media query 'max-width' to only apply those styles to mobile screens.

I noticed I'm just doing the opposite of fadeinout animation in fadeoutin.
I can just reversed the animation direction rather defining keyframes for a new animation.
animation-direction: alternate-reverse;

I went to back to previous commit and came back to this. 
Detached head. Easy fix. Just switch to the branch.

Don't move any file to any directory normally.
The file moved tracked as a new file because git thinks the old file is deleted and a new file is created.
It doesn't know it's the same file. Use 'git mv' to preserve the file history.
I moved style.css, index.html, and script.js to before-sass folder and commited yesterday.
index.html didn't move properly because I created a new html file with the same name but style.css did.
Previously style.css became before-sass/style.css.
index.html just got modified instead of renaming git file path.

Animation on load wasn't smooth. 
Fixed it by moving trasition related properties to '.animate' class from '.animatable' class.
Added no js fallback.

'textarea' element width went beyond its parent despite defining 'width: 100%'.
It's because the global reset 'box-sizing: border-box' got overridden by 'all: unset'.
Set the box-sizing again.

'.contact-form' bottom margin went inside the following element.
It's because setting 'transform: translateY(1rem)' for animation.
Padding does that too.
Increased the following element 'padding-top' to include the amount translated.

The '.divider' image inside the '.banner' element is kept appearing and disappearing.
The problem is its 'z-index' property was affected by '.crossfade' element.
That element affected the whole '.header__container' element and its children.
Fixed it by setting 'position: relative' in '.header__container'.
'z-index' only works on positioned elements.

Animation is applied before the social icon images are loaded.
It's apparent because the parents' borders are visible.
Verified it using 'HTMLImageElement.complete' API.
Wrapped the animation code inside 'window load' event.
However, it still persists when the page is refreshed.

Found the exact cause of '.divider' image appearing and disappearing problem.
It works fine when screen size is below 1024px.
That's because '.crossfade .crossfade--overlay' element opacity is set to '.35'.
It's opacity is set to '1' when screen size is more than 1023px.
If'.header__container' position is not set to 'relative', it appears on top.

Changed how I positioned '.banner' element inside the '.header__container'.
It was using nasty margin-bottom to make it appear approximately center of '.header__container' in different screen sizes.
I wanted a smooth way of doing it using different layout techniques.
By trying out, I learned how flexbox and grid work a little bit more.
It changed my understanding of 'align-*' and 'justify-*' properties.
Divided '.header__container' into 3 rows by 'grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr)'.
Set 'align-self: center' on '.banner' to center it along its space.

By trying to center '.banner', I also tried absolute positioning on '.navbar'.
It broke the '.menu' element inside it.

By trying to center '.banner', I found a way to make an element's height to fill the remaining height of the container.
Set 'display: table' on the container element.
Set 'display: table-row' on its children elements.
The children will have equal height if no element has a fixed height.
If an element has a fixed height, the other element or elements will take up the remaining height.
https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-make-a-div-fill-the-height-of-the-remaining-space.html

The above approach isn't ideal. Flexbox is better.
Set 'display: flex; flex-flow: column' on the container element.
Set 'flex' property on the child or children to adjust height.
